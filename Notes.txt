Notes
-----

The Dockerfile is used to build docker images. Most of the time we want to build our images from
prebuilt images on the docker hub. We specify the base image we want using the FROM keyword.

    FROM node:17

There are different commands we can run in the Dockerfile like.. 

    WORKDIR to set the working directory in the container. 
    
    RUN to execute commands at build time, ie when the image is being created.
    
    COPY to copy files from our machine to the container.

    CMD to run commands at run time. Commands that run on the container after it is built and is running.

Each command creates a layer of the docker image. When we build the image for the first time each
command is run and the results are cached.

    This means docker is very efficient when rebuilding images. If nothing has changed in a command
    the cached results are used instead of it being run again.

    When docker sees that a command line has changed and therefor a layer is changed all the lines 
    after it are rerun.

Once we have a Dockerfile we can build the image from the Dockerfile. If we are in the directory of the
docker file we can run...

    docker build .

To build the image giving it a name...

    docker build -t <name> .

When we run the above command we can see the output docker gives where we got through the Dockerfile step
by step and build each layer of the image.

We can see images we have built...

    docker image ls -a

We can remove docker images...

    docker image rm <image-id> <image-id>

Once we have built the docker image we can create a container from it, we can run it using...

    docker run -d --name <container-name> <image name or id>

        We run the docker image in detached mode and give it a name
